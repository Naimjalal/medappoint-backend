### **_Description_**

**Medappoint** is a full-stack hospital appointment and blood donation system designed to help patients easily book appointments with doctors in busy hospitals like Salmaniya, and register for blood donation.

It aims to solve common issues like:
- Difficulty in finding available appointment slots
- Long waiting times for scheduling
- Lack of centralized donation tracking across hospitals

This backend API manages the data and logic for users, appointments, doctors, hospitals, and blood donations.
